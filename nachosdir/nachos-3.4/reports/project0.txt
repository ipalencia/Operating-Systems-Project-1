Group 2 - Jonathan, Adeel, Ian

A) 
Before starting project 0, I thought it would be more difficult 
to download and set up Nachos. The process of installing and configuring
Nachos took minutes and was much easier than expected. I had no problem 
whatsoever running both the threads and userprog demos. 

B) 
Running the threads and userprog tests were very straight forward. Following
the commands in the nachos warmup file, I ran into no issues and produces 
the exact same output for both tests. 

C) 
The threads class is a fundamental part used for creating and managing 
threads within the OS. It provides resources for representing and manipulating
single threads. Some features of the thread class include thread creation, scheduling, 
switching, termination, synchronization, etc... The threads class is an essential part 
of this operating system.
